# Maktab

A web application featuring a simple student information system. Developed using Next.js (Reactjs), Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI, Flask, and PostgreSQL (Supabase).

This is actually version 3 of the other student information systems I've built before.

Version 1: [Gungnir](https://github.com/keaneph/Gungnir) - developed using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) with CSV as the database

Version 2: [La Accademia](https://github.com/keaneph/La-Accademia) - still WPF, but with MySQL as the database
